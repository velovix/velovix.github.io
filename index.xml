      <title>LGPL and GPL License Compliance with PyInstaller</title>

      <description>PyInstaller is a piece of software that attempts to bundle up a Python application and all its dependencies into a single executable. It&amp;rsquo;s an excellent tool that makes deployments (especially to end users) much easier. It is capable of bundling not only a project&amp;rsquo;s Python dependencies, but its C/C++ library dependencies as well.
This is great for any Python project that wants that self-contained, single-executable experience that compiled languages can offer.</description>

      <title>Movement Experimentation in Google Cardboard</title>

      <description>I love how accessible Google Cardboard is. Got a smartphone and $7? You&amp;rsquo;re fully equipped to experience virtual reality in your home.
With that comes some trade-offs, though. The stock Cardboard headsets don&amp;rsquo;t come with head straps (though solutions do exist), the interface consists of one button, and most people aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be running your application on top-of-the-line specs. Working with limitations can be fun, though. When used to its fullest extent, I think Cardboard can deliver some very cool little experiences.</description>

      <title>Dealing With Multiple Files in VIM</title>

      <description>The VIM learning curve is legendarily steep. As if the modal editing wasn&amp;rsquo;t tricky enough, a lot of basic editor features that most users take for granted appear at first to be absent completely, like syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and, as we&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about here, file navigation.
Some of these issues have simple solutions (:syntax on, for instance), but it turns out that dealing with multiple files in VIM is a complicated subject with a lot of solutions, some better than others.</description>

      <title>Remapping Caps Lock</title>

      <description>For me and many others, Caps Lock does little more than collect dust on the keyboard. These days, it seems pretty archaic to have a dedicated key for such a rarely-needed task. It&amp;rsquo;s very common to see people online talk about mapping Caps Lock to the CTRL key, which can make executing common chords like CTRL+S easier on the hands. In this post I describe my experience with the Caps Lock to CTRL mapping and why I ended up switching back.</description>
