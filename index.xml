&lt;p&gt;The VIM learning curve is legendarily steep. As if the modal editing wasn&amp;rsquo;t
tricky enough, a lot of basic editor features that most users take for granted
appear at first to be absent completely, like syntax highlighting,
autocomplete, and, as we&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about here, file navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these issues have simple solutions (:syntax on, for instance), but it
turns out that dealing with multiple files in VIM is a complicated subject with
a lot of solutions, some better than others. This post explores the various
options available, in an order that I believe most VIM beginners end up finding
them in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;option-1-tabs&#34;&gt;Option 1: Tabs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When researching this issue, new users are bound to find some mention of tab
support in VIM. They feel relieved by the familiar terminology and immediately
start using tabs like how tabs are used in editors like Atom and IntelliJ IDEA,
namely one buffer per tab. However, the seeming glint of familiarity is but a
trap for new users, as tabs in VIM are not like tabs in those editors, and the
new user will soon find tabs to be a very clunky solution to this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that new users intuitively think of tabs as places for
single files, but in VIM, they&amp;rsquo;re closer to what an IDE might call a &amp;ldquo;layout&amp;rdquo;.
Users expect tabs to be contained in windows, but in fact, it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite.
That makes tabs work very poorly as a container for a single file. This makes
tabs a &lt;em&gt;bad option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;option-2-raw-buffers&#34;&gt;Option 2: Raw Buffers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest solution to dealing with multiple files is to simply have VIM open
multiple files. Early on, I would open up a project by jumping to its directory
and running &lt;code&gt;vim *.c&lt;/code&gt; to open every C file, or &lt;code&gt;vim *.go&lt;/code&gt; to open every Go
file. Then I &amp;ldquo;simply&amp;rdquo; scrolled through each buffer with repeated calls to &lt;code&gt;bn&lt;/code&gt;
(buffer next) and &lt;code&gt;bp&lt;/code&gt; (buffer previous). If I needed to open up another file,
I would use the :e command followed by the path to the file. If I forgot what
it was called, then I had to go consult &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; or a file manager. That was
roughing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is closer to a right solution than tabs are, and I suspect that some
hardcore no-frills VIM users still do use this pattern. However, if you ask me,
using buffers on their own gets tiresome, and I much prefer using a tool to
help me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;option-3-netrw-and-buffers&#34;&gt;Option 3: Netrw and Buffers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netrw is VIM&amp;rsquo;s built-in file manager. When invoked, it takes over the buffer it
is run in, and replaces the buffer with whatever file you choose. Netrw is not
a bad option, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a great option either.  It&amp;rsquo;s notoriously buggy and a
lot of the bugs that appear in its less used features, like tree view, don&amp;rsquo;t
end up getting fixed because so few people use them. Personally, only
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar/issues/21&#34;&gt;one bug&lt;/a&gt; ever really bothered me, but
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/22ztqp/why_does_nerdtree_exist_whats_wrong_with_netrw/cgs4aax&#34;&gt;other people&lt;/a&gt;
seem to have a worse time than I. Your milage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;option-4-nerdtree-and-buffers&#34;&gt;Option 4: NERDTree and Buffers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NERDTree is another tool that makes beginner VIM users feel more at home. It
opens up a file tree as a split window on the left side of the workspace, just
like an IDE would. Users can jump to that window and select their file in a
very user-friendly way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think this is a very good option for new VIM users. The
familiarity is comforting, and unlike tabs, it&amp;rsquo;s not a trap. Some more advanced
users use NERDTree because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t tend to have the bugs that Netrw does.
Hardcore VIM-ers don&amp;rsquo;t tend to like NERDTree because they find it bloated,
though those tend to be the kind of people that think most any plugin is
unnecesary bloat. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s a very productive attitude for new
VIM-ers to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve moved away from the &amp;ldquo;project drawer&amp;rdquo; style of NERDTree and most every IDE,
because I find it isn&amp;rsquo;t a very good use of a space, but I know a lot of people
like project drawers and if you, dear reader, are one of those people, then
NERDTree is right up your alley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;option-5-vim-vinegar-and-buffers&#34;&gt;Option 5: vim-vinegar and Buffers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vim-vinegar plugin is for people like me that don&amp;rsquo;t mind Netrw&amp;rsquo;s bugs and
like that it takes over the whole window, but could benefit from a better user
experience. The plugin assigns &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; as the Netrw hotkey and automatically points
it to the directory of the file you&amp;rsquo;re currently editing. I find this to be
what I want 99.9% of the time and is, on its own, a huge improvement to Netrw.
It also does a whole bunch of smaller things that I also appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;vim-vinegar is the file explorer setup that I personally use, but it might not
fit everyone&amp;rsquo;s taste.  I encourage everyone to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;addons&#34;&gt;Addons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, consulting a file explorer isn&amp;rsquo;t always the way you want to switch
buffers. If you need to switch between two separate files a lot, that can get
pretty tedious. Here are some plugins that I have used to make that process
easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;minibufexpl-vim&#34;&gt;minibufexpl.vim&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond having a beautiful name that rolls right off the tongue, minibufexpl.vim
displays a list of open buffers as a small window at the top of the workspace
with their corresponding buffer numbers. This makes it easy to look up the
number of the buffer you want, and jump to it with &lt;code&gt;:#b&lt;/code&gt; where # is the buffer
number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up not sticking with this plugin for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not into project drawers. (see Option 4: NERDTree and Buffers)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some plugins leave behind buffers that clutter up the list. minibufexpl.vim
doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to know how to filter these out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;minibufexpl.vim is less useful the more files you have open. The longer that
list gets, the longer it takes for you to find the file you want to jump to.
It requires you to constantly clean up buffers you&amp;rsquo;re no longer using. Some
might call that best practice. I call it annoying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ctrlp-vim&#34;&gt;ctrlp.vim&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plugin will feel immediately familiar to users of IntelliJ IDEA who like
the CTRL+Shift+P feature. ctrlp.vim is a fuzzy finder for files in and past the
directory you started VIM in.  I find this to be an excellent complement to
vim-vinegar for files that are far away directory-wise but that you know the
name of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search algorithm ctrlp.vim uses isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as strong as IntelliJ&amp;rsquo;s. For
instance, you can&amp;rsquo;t type in an acronym and find a long Java class file, but
it&amp;rsquo;s good enough to be very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, ctrlp.vim is a bit of a project drawer plugin, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t
linger and I find it useful enough to forgive it for that sin. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Remapping Caps Lock</title>
      <link>https://velovix.github.io/post/remapping-caps-lock/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2016 20:49:33 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;For me and many others, Caps Lock does little more than collect dust on the
keyboard. These days, it seems pretty archaic to have a dedicated key for such
a rarely-needed task.  It&amp;rsquo;s very common to see people online talk about mapping
Caps Lock to the CTRL key, which can make executing common chords like CTRL+S
easier on the hands. In this post I describe my experience with the Caps Lock
to CTRL mapping and why I ended up switching back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-good&#34;&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first mapped Caps Lock to CTRL, it felt so freeing. Chords that normally
required me to move my hand down or strain my wrist I could pull off
effortlessly, like a skilled pianist.  It felt like this was the way keyboards
were meant to be laid out. As it turned out, at one point, they were laid out
that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://velovix.github.io/adm3a-keyboard.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ADM3A Keyboard&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to lend further credence to the idea that the CTRL as Caps Lock
layout is the way to go. So, why didn&amp;rsquo;t I keep it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;home-row-typing&#34;&gt;Home Row Typing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why Caps Lock as CTRL feels so good initially is because of how
little you need to move your hand in order to hit CTRL. You get to keep your
hands &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; on the home row. However, &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; is the key word here. Your
right hand stays right on the home row as always, but your left hand is shifted
a bit to the left, and so long as you&amp;rsquo;re holding Caps Lock, you have three
fingers to type on the home row instead of four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your milage may very on this, but for me, I found this awkward and hard to work
with. When using CTRL in the standard position, you still only have three
fingers, but the act of moving your hand down and tilting it counterclockwise
allows for easy access of just about every key on the left side of the keyboard
(save for maybe &amp;lsquo;q&amp;rsquo;) and your right hand naturally makes up the difference.
This just feels a lot more natural to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tab-controls&#34;&gt;Tab Controls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most any program with tabs have you move through them using the CTRL+Tab and
CTRL+Shift+Tab chords. Browsers are the biggest culprits here. Try pressing
either of these keys with Caps Lock as CTRL. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you&amp;rsquo;ll find
that you have to move your hand really far to the left of the keyboard and
attack the buttons from the side. Pressing CTRL+Shift+Tab is easy normally by
simply resting the thumb on CTRL+Shift and using the index finger to hit Tab.
With Caps Lock as CTRL it&amp;rsquo;s a real hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, I simply kept CTRL mapped to its functionality in
addition to Caps Lock, but that&amp;rsquo;s such a waste having two keys so close
together do the exact same thing. You can do a lot with those buttons which
I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss in my final point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pinky-strain&#34;&gt;Pinky Strain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/swap_CapsLock_Ctrl.html&#34;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; was the
first article I saw that made me challenge Caps Lock as CTRL. I actually don&amp;rsquo;t
like this article very much. The crux of its argument is that you can &amp;ldquo;easily&amp;rdquo;
press CTRL with the palm of your hand, but I personally have never used a
keyboard where I could do that comfortably. However, it does bring up a really
good point about pinky strain. The pinkies are the weakest fingers and having
them hit Caps Lock all the time started wearing on my pinky pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how is having CTRL mapped to the bottom-left of the keyboard any better? It
isn&amp;rsquo;t, but it makes wearing out your pinky a lot harder and less appealing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found the best solution to the CTRL problem is to &lt;em&gt;use CTRL less&lt;/em&gt;, and the
Caps Lock as CTRL layout encourages you to use it &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;. Phasing out CTRL may
not be an option for you depending on what kinds of programs you use, but if
you spend most of your time in an editor like VIM, you have options.
Personally, I mapped CTRL+W to Leader+W, where my leader is space bar. That
lessened my dependence on CTRL significantly and I could see an immediate
difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;better-options&#34;&gt;Better Options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, having to map both CTRL and Caps Lock to the same
functionality is a real shame considering the potential it squanders. For me, I
found that, while I&amp;rsquo;d spent all this time trying to bring the CTRL key closer
to the home row, I was ignoring a far greater evil: Arrow keys. Reaching for
the arrow keys on most keyboards is a trek of nearly Lewis and Clark
proportions.  I tend to pack my right hand with at least two bottles of water
and a granola bar before I send it on another arguous journey to the arrow
keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to remedy this problem, I&amp;rsquo;ve mapped Caps Lock to be a special
modifier key of sorts. When I hold it down, H, J, K, and L become the left,
down, up, and right arrow keys respectively, like in VIM.  I find that I use
the arrow keys significantly less than I use CTRL, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t personally had
any issues with pinky strain, and yet my comfort using the keyboard has
improved significantly.  Again, your milage may vary, but personally, I found
this to be a better use for the Caps Lock key.&lt;/p&gt;
